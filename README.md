# flatiron_mod_3_citibike
Edu Project for Flatiron School predicting citibike destinations

We will explore data from Citi Bike and look for classification models which we can make a prediction on. 

Hypothesis - Considering weather, start location, time, and other variables we can predict which neighborhood riders will likely ride to. 


We will start with the core data availble by month from Citi Bike. Next we will will join New York City weather data to add further variables. Lastly, we will join our station location into neighborhood classifications in order to predict a destination.
